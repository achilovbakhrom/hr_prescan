# Code Review

Review code for quality, security, performance, architecture, and consistency with project conventions.

## Usage

- `/review` — review all uncommitted changes (git diff)
- `/review all` — review the entire codebase (high-level scan)
- `/review backend` — review all backend code
- `/review frontend` — review all frontend code
- `/review backend/apps/accounts` — review a specific module
- `/review frontend/src/features/candidates` — review a specific feature
- `/review --fix` — review and auto-fix issues found

## Steps

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse the arguments:
- No args → review uncommitted changes (`git diff` + `git diff --cached` + untracked files)
- `all` → scan entire codebase (read key files, check structure)
- `backend` / `frontend` → scan that layer
- Specific path → review that directory/file
- `--fix` flag → fix issues after review

### 2. Read Project Conventions

Before reviewing, read:
- `CLAUDE.md` for project rules
- `docs/CODE_STYLE.md` if it exists
- `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` for domain context

### 3. File Size Check (CRITICAL — run first)

**Hard limit: 200 lines per file.** Any file exceeding 200 lines is a **Critical Issue**.

Run these checks:
- Backend: `find backend/apps -name "*.py" ! -path "*/migrations/*" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20` — flag any file over 200 lines
- Frontend: `find frontend/src -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs wc -l | sort -rn | head -20` — flag any file over 200 lines

For each oversized file, recommend a split strategy:
- **API files**: split by resource (e.g., `apis/profile.py`, `apis/education.py`, `apis/work_experience.py`)
- **Service files**: split by domain concern (e.g., `services/vacancy_crud.py`, `services/vacancy_ai.py`)
- **AI assistants**: extract tool definitions, handlers by domain, and utilities into separate modules
- **Vue components**: extract sub-components, composables, or split page sections
- **Store files**: extract actions into composables if store exceeds limit

### 4. Run Linters (Automated Checks)

Before the manual review, run automated linters to catch low-hanging fruit:

**Backend (Ruff):**
Run `cd backend && ruff check --select F401,F811,UP,B,DJ .` on the files in scope to catch:
- `F401` — unused imports
- `F811` — redefined unused variables
- `UP` — deprecated Python patterns (old-style typing, unnecessary `# coding`, `typing.Optional` → `X | None`, etc.)
- `B` — bugbear (mutable default args, assertions, etc.)
- `DJ` — Django-specific issues

If reviewing a specific path, pass that path instead of `.`. Report all findings as **Warnings** in the review output.

If `--fix` flag is set, run `ruff check --fix --select F401,F811,UP .` to auto-fix unused imports and deprecated patterns.

**Frontend (TypeScript):**
Run `cd frontend && npx vue-tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -80` to catch TypeScript errors including unused imports and type issues. If `vue-tsc` is not available, run `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty 2>&1 | head -80` as fallback.

Additionally, search for common deprecated patterns:
- `defineComponent()` in `<script setup>` files (unnecessary)
- `@/` imports that could use relative paths within the same feature
- Unused `ref`, `computed`, `watch` imports from Vue

**Linter Config:**
- Ruff config lives in `backend/pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`
- Suggest Ruff rule codes (e.g., `# noqa: S101`), not Flake8 codes
- Format suggestions should reference `ruff format`, not `black` or `autopep8`
- Import sorting is handled by Ruff's isort (`I` rules), not standalone isort

### 5. Backend Review (GRASP Principles)

Review backend Python/Django code against these criteria:

**Architecture (GRASP):**
- **Information Expert** — is logic placed in the class/module that has the data? Services should contain business logic, not views/serializers
- **Creator** — are objects created by the right module? (services create models, not views)
- **Controller** — do API views only handle HTTP concerns (parse input, call service, format output)?
- **Low Coupling** — are modules loosely coupled? Check for circular imports, cross-app direct model access
- **High Cohesion** — does each module have a single, clear responsibility?
- **Polymorphism** — are conditionals used where polymorphism would be cleaner?
- **Pure Fabrication** — are utility/service classes justified?
- **Indirection** — is the service layer used consistently (views → services → models)?
- **Protected Variations** — are interfaces stable? Are implementation details hidden?

**Project Patterns:**
- Service Layer: business logic in `services.py`, not in views or serializers
- Selectors: read queries in `selectors.py`, not inline in views
- Serializers: input validation + output formatting only, no business logic
- Models: data + constraints only, no business logic methods
- URLs: clean RESTful structure
- Migrations: no data loss, reversible where possible

**Dead Code & Deprecated Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY — check every file):**
- **Unused imports** — imports that are not referenced anywhere in the file. Flag every one. These are auto-fixable with `ruff check --fix --select F401`.
- **Unused variables/functions** — defined but never used. Check for functions, classes, constants that have no callers.
- **Deprecated Python patterns** — `typing.Optional[X]` → `X | None`, `typing.List[X]` → `list[X]`, `typing.Dict` → `dict`, `typing.Tuple` → `tuple`, `typing.Union[X, Y]` → `X | Y`. These are auto-fixable with `ruff check --fix --select UP`.
- **Deprecated Django patterns** — `django.conf.urls.url()` → `path()`, `@login_required` on API views (use permission classes), `JSONField` from `django.contrib.postgres` (use `django.db.models.JSONField`).
- **Stale commented-out code** — commented imports, commented function bodies, TODO/FIXME without context.

**Code Quality:**
- DRY — duplicated logic?
- Naming — clear, consistent, Pythonic?
- Error handling — using `ApplicationError` consistently? Catching too broad?
- Type hints — present and correct?
- N+1 queries — missing `select_related`/`prefetch_related`?
- Security — raw SQL, unsanitized input, exposed secrets, missing permission checks?

**Django-Specific:**
- Proper use of `update_fields` on save
- Transaction safety (`@transaction.atomic` where needed)
- QuerySet optimization (avoid `.all()` when filtering)
- Permission classes on all views
- Proper status code usage in responses

### 6. Frontend Review (Feature-Sliced Design)

Review frontend Vue/TypeScript code against FSD principles:

**Architecture (FSD Layers):**
- **app/** — only app-wide config (router, store init, global styles). No business logic.
- **shared/** — only reusable utilities, UI kit, API client, constants. No feature-specific code.
- **features/** — each feature is self-contained with its own pages, components, services, stores, types, routes
- **No cross-feature imports** — features should not import from each other directly. If shared, move to `shared/`
- **Layer direction** — shared → features → app. Never the reverse.

**Feature Structure (per feature):**
- `pages/` — route-level components, minimal logic, compose from components
- `components/` — presentational + container components
- `services/` — API calls only, no business logic
- `stores/` — Pinia stores with state, getters, actions
- `types/` — TypeScript interfaces and type aliases
- `routes.ts` — route definitions
- `constants/` — feature-specific constants

**Dead Code & Deprecated Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY — check every file):**
- **Unused imports** — Vue/TS imports not referenced in `<script setup>` or `<template>`. Common: importing a component/type/util that was removed from the template but the import remains.
- **Unused variables** — `const`/`ref`/`computed` defined but never used in template or script.
- **Deprecated Vue patterns** — `defineComponent()` inside `<script setup>` (unnecessary), Options API in new code, `this.$refs` instead of template refs, `@click.native` (removed in Vue 3).
- **Deprecated TypeScript patterns** — `as any`, `// @ts-ignore` (use `// @ts-expect-error`), `enum` where `as const` object suffices.
- **Stale commented-out code** — commented imports, commented template blocks, TODO/FIXME without context.

**Code Quality:**
- **TypeScript strictness** — no `any`, proper interfaces, discriminated unions for status types
- **Component size** — components over 300 lines should be split
- **Props vs emit** — proper data flow (props down, events up)
- **Reactivity** — proper use of `ref`, `computed`, `watch`. No reactivity loss.
- **PrimeVue usage** — using PrimeVue components correctly, not reimplementing
- **Tailwind** — consistent utility classes, no conflicting styles
- **Naming** — PascalCase components, camelCase functions/variables, kebab-case files
- **Error handling** — API errors caught and displayed, loading states

**Vue-Specific:**
- `<script setup>` used consistently
- Props properly typed with `defineProps<T>()`
- Emits properly typed with `defineEmits<T>()`
- No direct DOM manipulation (use refs)
- Computed properties for derived state (not methods)
- Watchers used sparingly and with clear purpose

### 7. Security Review (Both Layers)

- Authentication: all protected endpoints require auth
- Authorization: role-based access enforced (HR can't access admin endpoints)
- Input validation: all user input validated before processing
- XSS: no `v-html` with user content, no `innerHTML`
- CSRF: proper token handling
- Secrets: no hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- File uploads: validated file types and sizes
- SQL injection: using ORM, no raw SQL with user input

### 8. Performance Review

**Backend:**
- N+1 queries (missing `select_related`/`prefetch_related`)
- Unbounded querysets (missing pagination or limits)
- Heavy operations in request cycle (should be Celery tasks)
- Missing database indexes on frequently filtered fields

**Frontend:**
- Unnecessary re-renders (computed vs method)
- Large component trees without lazy loading
- Missing route-level code splitting
- Unoptimized watchers (watching entire objects vs specific properties)
- API calls without debouncing on user input
